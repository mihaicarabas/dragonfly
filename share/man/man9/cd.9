.Sh NAME
.Nm cd
.Nd CDROM driver for the CAM SCSI subsystem
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver provides a read only interface for CDROM drives
.Tn ( SCSI
type 5)
and WORM drives
.Tn ( SCSI
type 4)
that support CDROM type commands.
Some drives don't behave as the driver expects.  See the section
QUIRKS for info on possible flags.
.Sh QUIRKS
Each
.Tn CD-ROM
device can have different interpretations of the
.Tn SCSI
spec.  This can lead to drives requiring special handling in the driver.  The
following is a list of quirks that the driver recognize.
.Bl -tag -width CD_Q_BCD_TRACKS
.It Dv CD_Q_NO_TOUCH
This flag tell the driver not to probe the drive at attach time to see if
there is a disk in the drive and find out what size it is.  This flag is
currently unimplemented in the CAM
.Nm
driver.
.It Dv CD_Q_BCD_TRACKS
This flag is for broken drives that return the track numbers in packed BCD
instead of straight decimal.  If the drive seems to skip tracks
(tracks 10-15 are skipped)
then you have a drive that is in need of this flag.
.It Dv CD_Q_NO_CHANGER
This flag tells the driver that the device in question is not a changer.
This is only necessary for a CDROM device with multiple luns that are not a
part of a changer.
.It Dv CD_Q_CHANGER
This flag tells the driver that the given device is a multi-lun changer.
In general, the driver will figure this out automatically when it sees a
LUN greater than 0.  Setting this flag only has the effect of telling the
driver to run the initial read capacity command for LUN 0 of the changer
through the changer scheduling code.
