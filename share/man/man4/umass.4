.Sh NAME
.Nm umass
.Nd USB Mass Storage Devices driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device umass"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Mass Storage devices that attach to the USB
port.
Supported are
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Iomega USB Zip 100 drive
.It
Iomega USB Zip 250 drive
.It
Microtech International, Inc. USB-SCSI-HD 50 USB to SCSI cable.
.It
Panasonic ("Matshita FDD CF-VFDU03")
.It
Trek Thumbdrive 8MB
.It
VAIO floppy drive (includes Y-E Data Flashbuster-U)
.El
.Pp
The driver also supports some USB adapters for removable media.
Among the supported models are:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
SanDisk SDDR-31 (Compact Flash)
.It
SanDisk SDDR-75 (only Compact Flash port works)
.It
Sitecom CN-300 MultiFlash (MMC/SD, SmartMedia, CF, MemoryStick)
.El
.Pp
.Nm usb
and one of
.Nm uhci
or
.Nm ohci
must be configured in the kernel as well.
Last but not least, support for
SCSI drives,
.Nm da
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl device umass
.Dl device scbus
.Dl device da
.Dl device pass
.Pp
Add the
.Nm
driver to the kernel.
.Pp
.Dl camcontrol rescan 0
.Pp
Rescan a Zip drive that was added after boot.
The command above
assumes that the Zip drive is the first SCSI bus in the system.
.Pp
.Dl camcontrol rescan 0:0:0
.Dl camcontrol rescan 0:0:1
.Dl camcontrol rescan 0:0:2
.Dl camcontrol rescan 0:0:3
.Pp
Rescan all slots on a multi-slot flash reader, where the slots map to separate
LUNs on a single SCSI ID.  Typically only the first slot will be enabled at
boot time.  Again, this assumes that the flash reader is the first SCSI bus in
the system.
.Pp
.Dl disklabel -w -r da0s0 zip100
.Dl newfs da0s0c
.Dl mount -t ufs /dev/da0s0c /mnt
.Pp
Write a disklabel to the Zip drive (see
.Nm vpo
for the
.Nm disktab
entry), creates the filesystem and mounts the new filesystem on /mnt.
.Pp
.Dl newfs_msdos /dev/da0
.Pp
Create a new FAT type filesystem.
