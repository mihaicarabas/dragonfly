.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pa /dev/snp?
are snoop devices which allow users to attach to any tty
and watch activities on it.
The kernel must be compiled with
.Cd "device snp" ,
or the
.Nm
module must be loaded, for these devices to be available.

.Nm
device with a tty to be observed, open the
.Nm
device and then use the
.Dv SNPSTTY
ioctl.
The argument passed to the ioctl is the address of a variable of type
.Vt dev_t .
To detach the snp device from a tty use a pointer to a value of
.Vt ( dev_t ) Ns Li -1 .
.Pp
The
.Dv SNPGTTY
ioctl returns information about the current tty attached to the open
.Nm
device.
.Pp
The
.Dv FIONREAD
ioctl returns a positive value equal to the number of characters
in a read buffer.
Special values defined are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv SNP_TTYCLOSE"
.It Dv SNP_OFLOW
device overflow occurred, device detached.
