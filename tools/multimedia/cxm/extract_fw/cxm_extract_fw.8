.\".Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility transforms
.Xr cxm 4
.Tn Windows\[rg]
firmware into C language files which are needed for the driver to work.
.Pp
In order to create those files, run the
.Nm
utility on the
.Pa hcwPVRP2.sys
file which came on the
.Tn Windows\[rg]
driver CD-ROM.
The resulting
.Pa cxm_dec_fw.c
and
.Pa cxm_enc_fw.c
files have then to be copied to the
.Xr cxm 4
source directory (usually
.Pa /usr/src/sys/dev/video/cxm )
before compiling the kernel.
